I built a Rust library for X — here's what I learned

After 3 months of work, I released v1.0 of my-crate. It's a library for doing X in Rust with async support.

Key features:
- Zero allocations in hot path
- Full tokio integration
- Type-safe API

Here's a basic example:

```rust
use my_crate::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = Client::new().await;
    let result = client.process("input").await;
    println!("{}", result);
}
```

The hardest part was implementing the internal state machine. Rust's ownership made it tricky but the compiler caught so many bugs.

## Content Workflow

### 1. Start with Long-form (Blog)

Write comprehensive blog post first:
- Full explanation
- Multiple code examples
- Architecture decisions
- Trade-offs

### 2. Extract Snippets

Pull out 5-10 tweetable moments:
- Key features
- Performance numbers
- Interesting code snippets
- Tips learned

### 3. Adapt for Platforms

| Platform | Adaptation |
|----------|-----------|
| Twitter | Thread, shorten code, add emoji |
| Reddit | Full explanation, keep code blocks |
| Discord | Bullet points, inline code |
| HN | Technical focus, no marketing |

### 4. Schedule Posts

```
Day 1: Twitter thread + Reddit
Day 2: Discord communities
Day 3: Hacker News (if significant)
Day 7: Follow-up tips thread
```
